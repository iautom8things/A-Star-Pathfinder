# A* variables
# Python's built-in heapq module uses a plain ol' list as it's underlying data structure. Actually,
# heapq is just a set of functions that can be called on a list. Such as:
# 
#     heapify(list)
#     heappop(list)
#     heappush(list,item)
# 
# So open_list is the list that we'll use to store the f_scores of all the opened cells. The cell with the lowest
# f_score is of our highest priority, so when we call heapify(open_list) this will order the list so that the lowest
# score is the first element.

open_list = []      # our priority queue of opened cells' f_scores

# There's an issue with this, as you may have noticed. We're only keeping track of the f_scores of all the opened cells
# in open_list. When we retreive the lowest f_score, how do we know which cell is this? pq_dict is a ditionary for our
# priority queue. 

# When we pop the highest priority f_score out of open_list, we use this as a key to retreive the actual cell
# identifier from pq_dict

# but I'll explain now:
#
# To simplify the calculations of the g_score, if we move in an orthoganal direction, we consider the cost
# of this move to be 10, and not 1. We do this because of the cost of a diagonal move. Typically this would
# be the squareroot of 2 = 1.4142..

# To decrease the number of essentially useless computations, we round this to 1.4...and why deal with decimals?
